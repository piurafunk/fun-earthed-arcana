# Starting Languages

Your character begins play knowing at least three languages: Common, a language provided by the character's Background, and a language that you choose from the Standard Languages table below.
Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in that language and can read and write it.

The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread on D&D worlds in the Material Plane, and the Rare Languages table lists languages that are more rarely known on those works.
In each table, typical users of a language ar mentioned.
