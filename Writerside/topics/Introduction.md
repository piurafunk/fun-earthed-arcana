# Introduction

The first step in your Dungeons & Dragons journey is creating a character.
This character is how you will interact with the world, Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and fellow players.
There are three main elements of character creation:

- Class
- Species
- Background

Utilizing these three elements, you can create near limitless unique characters that can bring your Dungeons & Dragons campaign to life.

## Class

Your character class determines what kind of adventurer you want to play.
Classes give your characters unique abilities that they can use in many different situations in a campaign.

## Species

Species confer game traits to your character, such as creature type, size, and speed.
