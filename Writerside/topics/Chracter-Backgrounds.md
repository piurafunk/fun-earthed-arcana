# Chracter Backgrounds

Your character’s Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the  character before they embarked on a life of  adventure.

When you choose a Background, you have three options:

- Build a Background by using the rules in the  “Build Your Background” section.  
- Select a premade Background from the “Sample Backgrounds” section.
- Select a premade Background from the “Sample Backgrounds” section and then customize it with the rules in the “Build Your Background” section.


No matter which Background you choose, consider these questions from your character’s viewpoint:

- How does your Background influence your current worldview?
- Do you embrace or reject your Background?
- Did you form any relationships during your Background that endure today?

## Build Your Background

Using the rules here, you can build a Background from scratch or customize a premade Background, focusing on details  related to the backstory you have in mind for  your character.

When you build a Background, your character gains the features in the “Background Features” section below.
As you make choices for those features, think about your character’s past.
Where did they spend most of their time?
What  did they do for a living?
What capabilities and  possessions did they acquire?
What language  did they learn from their family, associates, or  studies?
How did their past affect their ability  scores?

If you instead decide to customize a premade Background, you can choose any features in that Background and replace them with the features below of the same name.
For example, if you want to change a Background’s Language feature, you can replace that feature with the Language feature below.

**Background Features**  
**Ability Scores.** When you determine your  character’s ability scores, choose two of them, and increase one by 2 and the other one by 1.
Alternatively, choose three ability scores, and increase each of them by 1.  
**Skill Proficiencies.** Choose two Skills.
Your character gains Proficiency in them.  
**Tool Proficiency.** Choose one tool.
Your character gains Tool Proficiency* with it.  
**Language.** Choose one language from the Standard Languages and Rare Languages table (these appear later in the documentation).
Your character knows that language.  
**Feat.** Choose one 1st-level Feat.
Your character gains that Feat.  
**Equipment.** Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting equipment.
The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

## Ability Score Increases From Elsewhere

Since 2014, characters have received ability score increases from several sources, either from a Species that has the Ability Score Increase trait or from the ability score rules in Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, Monsters of the Multiverse, and other books.
If you make a character using one of those older sources and get ability score increases from it, the character doesn't also get ability score increases from Background, unless you forgo the older ability score increases to gain the increases from the Background rules here.
