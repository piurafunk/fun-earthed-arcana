# Feats

This section offers a collection of 1st-level Feats, which are special features not tied to a single Class.
At 1st level, your character gains a Feat from the character's Background.

## Parts of a Feat

The description of a Feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the Feat's name:

**Level.** Each Feat has a level.
To take a Feat, your level must equal or exceed the Feat's level.  
**Prerequisite.** You must meet any prerequisite specified in a Feat to take that Feat.
If you lose a Feat's prerequisite, you can't use that Feat until you regain the prerequisite.  
**Repeated.** If a Feat is repeatable, you can take it more than once.
If it isn't repeatable, you can take the Feat only once.
