# Ardling

# Playtest 1
Ardlings are supernal beings who are either born on the Upper Planes or have one or more ancestors who originated there.
Their bright souls shine with the light of immortal beings who call the Upper Planes home.

An ardling has a head resembling that of an animal, typically one with virtuous associations.
Depending on the animal, the ardling might also have soft fur, downy feathers, or supple bare skin.
The ardling's celestial legacy determines the animal it resembles.

An ardling gains a measure of magical power from their celestial legacy, as well as the ability to manifest spectral wings.
An ardling's moral and ethical outlook is self-determined, however, not fixed by ancestry.

The three celestial legacies are as follows:

**Exalted.** The fierce passions of Arborea, the heroic heart of Ysgard, and the wondrous nature of the Beastlands call to ardlings who have the Exalted celestial legacy. Their celestial ancestors are heroic champions of the Chaotic Good planes.  
**Heavenly.** The blissful harmony of Arcadia, the unwavering justice of Mount Celestia, and the bucolic paradise of Bytopia touch the souls of ardlings who have the Heavenly celestial legacy. Their celestial ancestors are staunch defenders of the Lawful Good planes.  
**Idyllic.** The Idyllic celestial legacy connects ardlings not only to the Beastlands and Bytopia but also to the eternal compassion of Elysium. Their celestial ancestors are paragons of kindness who hail from the Neutral Good planes.  

## Ardling Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid  
**Size:** Medium (about 4-7 feet tall) or Small (about 3-4 feet tall), chosen when you select this Species  
**Speed:** 30 feet  
**Life Span:** 200 years on average

As an Ardling, you have these special traits.

**Angelic Flight.** As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings for a moment and fly up to a number of feet equal to your Speed.
If you are in the air at the end of this movement, you fall if nothing is holding you aloft.

You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.*

**Celestial Legacy.** You are the recipient of a celestial legacy that grants you magical abilities.
Choose a legacy from the Celestial Legacies table: Exalted, associated with Chaotic Good planes; Heavenly, associated with Lawful Good planes, or Idyllic, associated with Neutral Good planes.
You gain the initial benefit of the chosen legacy: a cantrip that you learn.
You also choose the animal you most closely resemble; the table provides a few suggestions for each legacy (you don't gain wings by choosing an animal that can fly).

Starting at 3rd level and again at 5th level, you gain the ability to cast a higher-level Spell with this trait, as shown on the table.
Once you cast the Spell with this trait, you can't cast that Spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest; however, you can cast the Spell using any Spell Slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the Spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the legacy).

|Legacy|Suggested Animals|1st Level|3rd Level|5th Level|
|Exalted|Cat, eagle, goat, mule|Thaumaturgy|Divine Favor|Lesser Restoration|

|Idyllic|Bear, dog, raven, toad|Guidance|Healing Word|Animal Messenger|

**Damage Resistance.** You have resistance to Radiant Damage.

## Ardlings of Many Worlds

Ardlings bring a little bit of the Upper Planes with them wherever they go.
On many worlds, the first ardlings used the magic of their celestial legacies to inspire and heal others.

By virtue of their celestial legacies, some ardlings strive to make the world a better place.
Others use their supernal gifts to be the best version of themselves they can be.
Still others are delighted to have a connection to the Upper Planes without the responsibility of always having to do the right thing.


# Playtest 3

Celestial animals roam the Beastlands, a plane of untamed beauty and wild nature.
Many of those otherworldly animals serve the Beast Lords, and in the early days of the multiverse, some of the animals evolved into bipedal forms.
Among their number are Ardlings, people with beastlike heads, keen senses, and an innate connection to divine magic.
Long ago, the ancestors of Ardlings migrated to the Material Plane, and Ardlings can now be found on many worlds.

An Ardling has a head resembling that of an animal.
Depending on the animal, the Ardling might also have fur, feathers, or scales.
Some little and others hulking, Ardlings are as varied as the animals they resemble.

**Size:** Medium (about 4–7 feet tall) or Small (about 3–4 feet tall), chosen when you select this Species  
**Speed:** 30 feet  
**Life Span:** 200 years on average

As an Ardling adventurer, you have the following special traits.

### Animal Ancestry

You are descended from a Celestial animal.
Choose one of the ancestry types below, then choose one of the example animals listed for that ancestry (or a similar animal); you gain the benefits of that ancestry, and your head resembles the head of the chosen animal:

**Climber (Bear, Cat, Lizard, Squirrel).** You have hooked claws, sharp nails, or a serpentine tail.
As a result, you have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed, and once per turn when you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike to a target, you can increase the damage to that target by an amount equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

**Flyer (Bat, Eagle, Owl, Raven).** You have vestigial wings.
As a result, when you fall at least 10 feet, you can use your Reaction to safely glide downward, taking no damage from the fall.
In addition, when you take the Jump Action, you can flap your wings to gain Advantage on that Action’s Ability Check.

**Racer (Deer, Dog, Horse, Triceratops).** When you take the Dash Action, your Speed increases for that Action.
The increase equals ten times your Proficiency Bonus.

In addition, you have Resistance to Cold Damage.

### Divine Magic

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace that Spell with a different 0-level Spell from the Divine Spell list.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for any Spell you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the Species).

### Keen Senses

You have Proficiency in the Perception Skill.
