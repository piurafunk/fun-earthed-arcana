# Character Species

When you choose your character's Species, you determine whether your character is a member of the human species or of a fantastical species.
This document provides descriptions and rules for the following Species options: Human, Ardling, Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling, Orc, and Tiefling.

The description of each Species includes a section of game traits, which your character gains if you select that Species.
NPCs of the same ancestry don't necessarily have the same traits, as explained in the Monster Manual; the traits here pertain to player characters.

## Children of Different Humanoid Kinds

Thanks to the magical workings of the multiverse, Humanoids of different kinds sometimes have children together.
For example, folk who have a human parent and an orc or an elf parent are particularly common.
Many other combinations are possible.

If you'd like to play the child of such a wondrous pairing, choose two Species options that are humanoid to represent your parents.
Then determine which of those Species options provides your game traits: Size, Speed, and special traits.
You can then mix and match visual characteristics - color, ear shape, and the like - of the two options.
For example, if your character has a halfling and a gnome parent, you might choose Halfling for your game traits and then decide that your character has the pointed ears that are characteristic of a gnome.

Finally, determine the average of the two options' Life Span traits to figure out how long your character might live.
For example, a child of a halfling and a gnome has an average life span of 288 years.
