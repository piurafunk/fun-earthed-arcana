# Determining Your Origin

After choosing your character's Class, it's time  to consider the character's origin. Who are the  character's ancestors? And how did the  character spend the years leading up to a life of  adventure? To help answer those questions, you  choose three things for the character:

- a Species
- a Background
- a language

A character's Species represents ancestry and confers game traits to the character.
A character's Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the character.
The Character Origin Overview table lists the traits your character gains from Species and Background.

## Character Origin Overview
---

|-|-|
|Species Trait|Description|
|Creature Type|Every character and monster in the game as a Creature Type.|
|Size|A character's Size determines the amount of space the character occupies, as explained in the 2014 Player's Handbook.|
|Speed|Speed fuels a character's movement, as explained in the 2014 Player's Handbook.|
|Life Span|This life span is an average for a member of the Species - assuming the dangers of adventure don't shorten that span!|
|Special Traits|Each Species provides special traits - a collection of abilities that characters gain from their ancestors.|

|-|-|
|Background Trait|Description|
|Ability Score Bonus|A Background grants a +2 bonus to one ability score and a +1 bonus to a different one.|
|Skill Proficiencies|You get two Skill Proficiencies from a Background.|
|Tool Proficiency|Each Background gives Tool Proficiency* with one tool.|
|Language|A character learns one language from a Background.|
|Feat|Each Background provides a 1st-level Feat - a special ability acquired in the character's past.|
|Equipment|A Background provides a portion of a character's starting equipment, with the rest coming from Class.|


Species and Background together help bring your character's backstory into focus, and they distinguish the character from other members of the same Class.
For example, two characters might both be members of the Fighter Class, but if one is a Human Guard and the other is a Dwarf Gladiator, the two bring different capabilities and flavor to the Class.

After choosing a Species and a Background, you choose a language that your character knows, in addition to the Common tongue and whatever language you gained from the Background you chose.

The combination of Species, Background, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination, as you ponder your character's earliest days and imagine the character's family, occupation, hometown, and more.
